# Coffee Machine Application Module

This module is responsible for orchestrating the domain logic to fulfill the application's use cases. It acts as a bridge between the input adapters (e.g., the CLI) and the core domain model.

## Application Layer Overview

The application layer is composed of a set of use cases, each of which represents a single, atomic operation that can be performed by the user. These use cases are implemented as simple classes that depend on output ports (repositories) to interact with the domain model and external systems.

### Use Cases

*   **`BrewCoffee`**: Brews a coffee recipe. It loads the `CoffeeMachine` and `Recipe` aggregates, invokes the `brew` method on the `CoffeeMachine`, and saves the updated machine state.
*   **`ManageMachine`**: Turns the coffee machine on or off.
*   **`RefillMachine`**: Refills the water tank, bean hopper, or empties the waste bin.
*   **`GetMachineStatus`**: Retrieves the current status of the coffee machine.
*   **`BrowseRecipes`**: Retrieves a list of all available coffee recipes.

## Request Lifecycle Sequence Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the sequence of events for a typical `brew` command, from the user's input to the final state change in the database.
